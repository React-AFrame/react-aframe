# react-aframe
React AFrame wrapper to help React developers easily build (web)VR experiences.

## Getting Started
**Download Repository**\
Download repository by (in your terminal) navigating to your development folder and running command:

` git clone https://github.com/React-AFrame/react-aframe.git `

*(Must have  'git' installed on machine, for installation instructions visit [HERE](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git))*

**Install Dependencies**\
Install required packages by running command:

` npm install `

*(Must have  'node' and 'npm' installed on machine, for installation instructions visit [HERE](https://nodejs.org/en/download/))*

**Start Development Server**
Start server by running command:

*(The server will then be running on 'http://localhost:3000/')*

To update content, connect a database and update the Scene.js componentDidMount method with a DB call that retrieves items from DB and assigns their value to 'this.state.vrObjects'.


*This package was built using create-react-app (Learn more about updating, creating development builds, ejecting and other react-scripts [HERE](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app))*
